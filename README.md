<p>
 Welcome to my reverse engineering, binary exploitation(exploit development) and malware analysis study journey, here is my collection of all challenges that I found and resolve for having fun and learn more about these fields that I'm really passionate.
</p>

<p>
 I will put on the repository the sample analyzed and the Write-Up( in .pdf and on the README of each repository) - If is a malware, I will put into a zip folder without the extension
</p>

<p>
  If you want to send some challenge for me to solve, have some tip or resource to I study, or want to ask some question, please check my profile and contact me
